          Free software lover, computing enthusiast and full-stack developer. I spend most of my time learning new things
          and improving my knowledge and skills. I'm crazy by the world of machine learning, artificial neural networks,
          and data analysis. Always I can, I try to collaborate on projects written in python or go or start my owns.
