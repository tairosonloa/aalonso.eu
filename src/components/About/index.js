          Free software lover, computing enthusiast and full-stack developer. I spend most of my time learning new things
          and improving my knowledge and skills. I'm crazy by the world of machine learning, artificial neural networks,
          and data analysis. My preferred programming languages are Python, Golang and JavaScript.
