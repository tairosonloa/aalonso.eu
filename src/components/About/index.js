        <h2>Who am I</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Aitor Alonso, and I'm currently studying a Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at
          Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, EPS Higher Polytechnic School of Legan√©s, Spain. Previously, I studied 
          a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the same university, where I focused and

          Free software lover, computing enthusiast and full-stack developer. I spend most of my time learning new things
          and improving my knowledge and skills. I'm crazy by the world of machine learning, artificial neural networks,
          and data analysis. My preferred programming languages are Python, Golang and JavaScript. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm always proactive, such a looking forward to learning. I'm not afraid of making errors, because I'm human,
          and I learn from my mistakes.
