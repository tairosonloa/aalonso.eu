I want to consolidate my Node.js Knowledge. Every time I look around Node.js it is becoming more and more popular (what I love it), and the most of the free software and open source projects in which I am involved are using Node.js as its main language.

Because of that, today I decided to start a new course about it on Udemy. There are many ways in which I can take advantage of this course, in my opinion. On the one hand, it will allow me to undo the bad habits I have acquired when learning Node.js by doing, when I was participating in some projects in which I had to get things up and running as soon as possible. On the other hand, it will let me go in depth about Node.js: its peculiarities, differences and advanced aspects of the language.

I love Node.js because I love the power and strength of JavaScript, because it allows to develop cross platforms applications with relative effort and clean code, and because it is nearly a tailor made tool to some backends development. I'm very excited of becoming an experienced Node.js developer!
