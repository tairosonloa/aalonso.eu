A new redesign has born! Recently, I have updated my CV and Linkedin profile. I'm graduated from my Bachelor's Degree and **looking for my next career jump**, so I decided to take a look at my professional image. Last, but not least, the time to update the web has arrived.

The first design of my web was pure HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript; as a product of my first steps in the frontend world. It was late 2016, and I was at the middle of my Computer Science and Engineering Degree. Later, on early 2018 I started to make the frontend to [my Final Degree Project](/bachelor-degree-thesis/), and I got involved in developing GUI with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and the static site generator [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for it.

I programmed using [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) before but never React, and when I started I got in love at the moment. Thanks to a friend, Lucas, I could be aware of the existence of Gatsby. I used it to develop my FDP interface and I loved it so much that I decided to upgrade my *old school* website. The result was the following:

However, I was a newbie using React and Gatsby and I did a fast development taking a features rich public starter as a template. As result, I finished with the modern design I wanted to my website, but with a shitty code and without properly understanding of how Gatsby and my website were working. **I made I mistake from which I have learned** to do not repeat it again.

This time, I went through the Gatsby tutorials and took an easy starter template, just with a sidebar and a single page. With the knowledge I acquired through the tutorials, I developed the rest of the website and designed it as I wanted, adding new elements, styles, effects and logic. Now, **I fully understand** how my web if structured (at source code level) and how everything work together. I'm very proud of this new design that reflects my new knowledge and love about Gatsby.

I hope you like it as the much I love it!

PS: for the curious ones. The web is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) directly from my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tairosonloa/aalonso.eu).
