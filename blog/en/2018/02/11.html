				<p>
					Some people have asked me why I chose <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/" target="_blank">ArchLinux</a> as my main
					GNU/Linux distro, and why not Ubuntu or its parent Debian. Well, I'll explain why I'm in love with my ArchLinux
					installation.
				</p>
				<p>
					I think there are three many reasons for what I tested ArchLinux and I still stay here, more than two years later. Those
					are its documentation (and its community), with its huge and fully wiki; its philosophy (hackable and rolling release),
					and its packages manager, pacman. I really love its packages manager.
				</p>
				<h3>Wiki and community</h3>
				<p>
					I started in the GNU/Linux world with Debian, and it was many the times that I had a problem (so usual in a newbie
					user like I was) because I didn't understand something, or I wanted to do something and I didn't know how... or touching
					my installation I broked something and I had to fix it (so usual too at those times). So when I searched on the internet
					for help, always the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/" target="_blank">ArchLinux wiki</a> came to the rescue. As I
					said, it's huge and fully documented, and it was (and it is) so useful to understand the main of GNU/Linux. There is all
					well explained, sometimes with examples, and nowadays it still helps me when I need it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Its community is also very good compared to other distributions. People are patient with newbie users, and always trying to
					help. The community is very active, especially in the <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/" target="_blank">forums</a>.
					There is also a users repository (<a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/" target="_blank">AUR</a>) of which I'll tell you
					later. Going back to the wiki, a good way to start contributing to free software is helping on its documentation. I help to
					complete and update the wiki like many users do. I also help to translate pages from English to Spanish. I invite you
					to do the same with your favorite free software project.
				</p>
				<h3>ArchLinux philosophy</h3>
				<p>
					About its philosophy, it adjusts perfectly to my way of doing the things. I'm a type of user that likes to have its system
					clean and to know everything that happens on it and everything that is installed on it. Also, I love to configure my system
					and learn in the process about how the things work. The ArchLinux install process push you on that way because the installation
					is entirely by terminal commands, and after that, the system you get has the minimum and essentially software possible. It's
					such a clean installation that even it hasn't X support or a desktop environment by default. If you want X, you must
					install it. This is a perfect way to make your own system, to know what it has and what it has not, and to learn in the process.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also, I'm a kind of a <i>geek</i> that loves on having and trying the most recent version of a software, without needing to
					wait for months for my distro maintainers to release that version on the official repositories. I hate the frozen distros like
					Debian or Ubuntu because of the same reason (of many others), and also because a distro upgrade can break everything, what
					it's "impossible" on ArchLinux, because it's rolling release and it will be always up to date.
				</p>
				<p>
					To finish writing about ArchLinux philosophy, I want to highlight that the official ArchLinux position is KISS (<i>Keep It
					Simple Stupid</i>), and I think they really achieve it with the type of system you get after a fresh install, and the marvelous
					work of its packages manager. Indeed the installation process can be scary, but it's also full
					<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide" target="_blank">documented on the wiki</a>, the
					steps are very simple and you learn a lot in the process.
				</p>
				<h3>Pacman, more than a packages manager</h3>
				<p>
					Well, I'm really in love with that packages manager. <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman" target="_blank">Pacman</a>
					is really a good piece of software that makes the process to install, uninstall, purge and manage your packages easy peasy.
					There were some things of ArchLinux that attracted me to install it like I have just explained in the previous paragraphs,
					but the first thing that did me feel at home and to know I wasn't wrong was pacman. It manages packages dependencies with
					skill and in all this time I never have had a problem with broken packages, dependencies or similar (very usual in my times
					using apt or apt-get in Debian and Ubuntu).
				</p>
				<p>
					Also, when you deinstall a package, you can purge all its dependencies that aren't used from another package and also delete
					its config files and everything you can imagine with a single command. For sure, pacman is still more powerful, but I cannot
					dedicate all the article to speak about its wonders. You can check all its functions on the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman" target="_blank">wiki</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					And there is the users repository. More specifically, the
					<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository" target="_blank">ArchLinux Users Repositories (AUR)</a>.
					What does that mean? It means that it doesn't matter what package or software are you looking for. If you can't find it on
					the distro official repositories, you can be sure it will be on the AUR. Don't you believe me? Try it! Users upload to AUR
					a PKGBUILD (a script to automate the installation of a external package) that you can download. It serves to get the packages
					sources, its dependencies, compile it (if needed) and install it using pacman. Also, there are AUR helpers that simplify it
					even more. In my case I use <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pacaur/" target="_blank">pacaur</a>.
				</p>
				<h3>These are my reasons</h3>
				<p>
					So that's it. I'm in love with ArchLinux, and you can see I have reasons to. If I have convinced you and you want to install
					it, you can donwload ArchLinux from <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/download/" target="_blank">here</a> and check the
					installation guide <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide" target="_blank">here</a>. Welcome to this
					marvelous community!
