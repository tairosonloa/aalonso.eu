In mid 2017So in mid 2016 I heard about LaTeX thanks to my friends Clara and Axel. I loved the professional style that it provided to documents, and I read about its extended use for academic reports. I loved its look and feel so much that I decided to start using it on my owns reports.

Was reading and learning about LaTeX templates, and I decided to make my own. In part motivated because the excitation of experimenting, but also because I like to leave my footprint on everything I do, as a personal touch.

So now I polished my LaTeX template and released it as free software (under MIT license) on [GitHub](https://github.com/tairosonloa/UC3M_LaTeX_template/tree/e9289ab388543be4eaa85bb1a07eb38bb386e55a). I developed report and slides templates for academic works and presentations at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, and everyone its free to use it as they want!
