I was thinking about how to enhance my CV and I decided to go for an [Amazon Web Services certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/). Amazon provide three associate certifications: [Solutions Architect](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/), [SysOps Administrator](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/), and [Developer](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/).

If maybe the Developer certification could fit better on my career profile, I chose to go for the Solutions Architect certification. The reason was that this certification focuses on the core AWS services, like Identity and Access Management (IAM), Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), S3, and EC2. Studying these core services will give me a good understanding of how AWS approaches security, networking, data storage, and compute capability. In essence, a good understanding of how the core of AWS works. Later, If I want to go for another certification, I think it will be easier if I already have the Solutions Architect one.

I'm preparing the certification by my own, And I'm relying on an udemy course: [Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate 2019](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c01/), by Stephane Maarek. Mareek has its course very up to date, and he interacts a lot with his students, improving his course with their comments. He updates the course exercises and lessons to the last AWS implementation and exams. It can be seen that this is a very careful course and I'm very happy with it.

I'm very motivated with this new trip I have started, and I hope to get fun as long as it will go!
