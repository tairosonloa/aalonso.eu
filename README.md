Welcome to my website GitHub repository! This site is hosted on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and it's made with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). You can visit my website under the url [aalonso.eu](https://aalonso.eu).

## About its deployment
I have created and CI/CD pipeline to deploy this site, an automated sequence of events that is initiated after I update the code for my website on my local computer. These events take care of the work that I would otherwise need to perform manually: previewing my in-development site, testing my new code, and deploying it to the production server. These actions are powered by GitHub, Netlify, and Travis CI.
